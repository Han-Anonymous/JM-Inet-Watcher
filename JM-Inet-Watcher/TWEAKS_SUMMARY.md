# 🔧 UI Tweaks and Improvements

## ✅ **Tweaks Implemented**

### **1. Window State Fix** 🪟
- **Issue**: App opened in maximized state
- **Solution**: Changed to `WindowState.Normal` (restored state)
- **Added**: `WindowStartupLocation="CenterScreen"` for better positioning
- **Benefit**: App now opens in a comfortable, centered window

### **2. System Tray Double-Click Fix** 🖱️
- **Issue**: First double-click did nothing, required second double-click
- **Root Cause**: Simple lambda wasn't handling window state properly
- **Solution**: Created dedicated `NotifyIcon_DoubleClick` method with robust logic

#### **Enhanced Double-Click Behavior:**
```csharp
private void NotifyIcon_DoubleClick(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    if (WindowState == WindowState.Minimized || !IsVisible)
    {
        RestoreFromTray(); // Restore from tray
    }
    else
    {
        // If already visible, bring to front
        Activate();
        Focus();
        Topmost = true;
        Topmost = false; // Reset to normal behavior
    }
}
```

#### **Improvements Made:**
- ✅ **Reliable restoration**: Checks both `WindowState` and `IsVisible`
- ✅ **Better focus**: Added `Focus()` call for proper activation
- ✅ **Bring to front**: Uses `Topmost` trick to ensure window appears above others
- ✅ **Consistent behavior**: Works on first click every time

### **3. Author Credit Added** 👨‍💻
- **Location**: Bottom of main content card
- **Design**: Elegant card with developer emoji and styled text
- **Styling**: 
  - Background matches app's surface color
  - Border with subtle accent
  - Your name highlighted in accent blue
  - Professional caption typography

#### **Visual Design:**
```xml
